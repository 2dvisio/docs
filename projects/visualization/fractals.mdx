# Fractals and mathematical curves

Interactive web-based visualizations exploring mathematical concepts through fractals, space-filling curves, and geometric transformations.

## Fractal visualizations

### Mandelbrot set
The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal defined by iterating the complex function z → z² + c. The visualization shows which complex numbers remain bounded under iteration.

**Features:**
- Zoom and pan to explore infinite detail
- Color mapping based on iteration count
- Real-time rendering
- Interactive parameter adjustment

### Julia sets
Julia sets are related to the Mandelbrot set, showing the behavior of the iteration z → z² + c for different constant values of c.

**Features:**
- Multiple Julia set variations
- Parameter exploration
- Smooth color gradients
- High-resolution rendering

## Space-filling curves

### Hilbert curve
The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that maps a one-dimensional line to a two-dimensional space while preserving locality.

**Applications:**
- Data structure visualization
- Spatial indexing concepts
- Recursive algorithm demonstration
- Fractal dimension exploration

### Peano curve
The Peano curve was the first space-filling curve discovered, demonstrating that a continuous curve can pass through every point in a square.

**Features:**
- Iterative construction visualization
- Animation of curve generation
- Multiple iteration levels
- Educational step-through

## Geometric transformations

Interactive demonstrations of:
- Affine transformations
- Recursive patterns
- Symmetry operations
- Iterated function systems

## Technical implementation

The visualizations use:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript for mathematical computation
- Recursive algorithms for fractal generation
- Efficient rendering techniques for real-time interaction

## Educational value

These visualizations help understand:
- Recursive algorithms and iteration
- Complex number mathematics
- Fractal geometry concepts
- Computational complexity
- The relationship between simple rules and complex patterns
