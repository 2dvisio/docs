# Respiratory rate monitor

A web-based tool that uses computer vision and signal processing to estimate respiratory rate from webcam video in real-time.

## Overview

This project demonstrates non-contact respiratory monitoring by analyzing subtle motion patterns captured by a standard webcam. It showcases applications of computer vision in health monitoring.

## How it works

### Motion detection
1. Captures video frames from webcam
2. Analyzes pixel intensity changes over time
3. Focuses on chest/torso region
4. Extracts motion signal from video

### Signal processing
1. Filters noise from motion signal
2. Applies frequency analysis
3. Identifies periodic breathing pattern
4. Calculates respiratory rate (breaths per minute)

### Visualization
- Real-time waveform display
- Respiratory rate estimation
- Signal quality indicators
- Visual feedback for positioning

## Technical implementation

**Technologies used:**
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript for signal processing
- WebRTC for webcam access
- Fourier analysis for frequency detection

**Key algorithms:**
- Motion detection via frame differencing
- Band-pass filtering for respiratory frequencies
- Peak detection for breath counting
- Smoothing and noise reduction

## Use cases

### Research and development
- Prototype for contactless vital sign monitoring
- Algorithm testing and validation
- Educational demonstration

### Proof of concept
- Feasibility of webcam-based monitoring
- Signal processing technique evaluation
- User interface design exploration

## Limitations

- Requires stable positioning
- Sensitive to lighting conditions
- Motion artifacts can affect accuracy
- Not a medical-grade device

## Access

The respiratory rate monitor is available through the portfolio website. It requires webcam access and works best in well-lit, stable conditions.
