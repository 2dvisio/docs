# Respiratory rate monitor

A web-based tool that uses computer vision and signal processing to estimate respiratory rate in real-time using a standard webcam.

## Overview

This project demonstrates non-contact respiratory monitoring by analyzing subtle motion patterns captured by a webcam. It showcases applications of computer vision and signal processing in health monitoring.

## How it works

### Motion detection
The system analyzes video frames to detect small movements associated with breathing:
1. Captures video stream from webcam
2. Identifies region of interest (chest/abdomen area)
3. Tracks pixel intensity changes over time
4. Extracts motion signal from video frames

### Signal processing
Raw motion data is processed to extract respiratory patterns:
- **Filtering**: Removes noise and isolates breathing frequency range
- **Peak detection**: Identifies individual breaths
- **Rate calculation**: Computes breaths per minute
- **Smoothing**: Averages over time window for stable estimate

### Visualization
Real-time display of:
- Live video feed with region of interest overlay
- Respiratory waveform showing breathing pattern
- Current respiratory rate estimate
- Signal quality indicators

## Technical implementation

**Technologies used:**
- HTML5 Canvas for video processing
- JavaScript for signal processing algorithms
- WebRTC for webcam access
- Real-time rendering and computation

**Key algorithms:**
- Motion amplification techniques
- Bandpass filtering (typical breathing frequency: 0.2-0.5 Hz)
- Peak detection with adaptive thresholding
- Moving average for rate estimation

## Applications

This approach demonstrates potential for:
- **Remote patient monitoring**: Non-contact vital sign assessment
- **Sleep studies**: Breathing pattern analysis during sleep
- **Telemedicine**: Respiratory assessment during video consultations
- **Research**: Algorithm development for contactless monitoring

## Limitations

Current limitations include:
- Requires stable lighting conditions
- Sensitive to subject movement
- Accuracy depends on camera quality
- Not a medical device (research/educational purposes only)

## Try it out

The respiratory rate monitor is available as an interactive web tool. It requires:
- Modern web browser with webcam support
- Adequate lighting
- Stable positioning of subject
- Permission to access webcam
