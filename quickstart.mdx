# Quick start

This guide helps you navigate the projects and understand what each area covers.

## Digital health projects

Explore telehealth platforms and clinical research systems I've developed:

### GDm-health
Remote monitoring platform for gestational diabetes management. Enables pregnant women to track blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight while receiving clinical support.
